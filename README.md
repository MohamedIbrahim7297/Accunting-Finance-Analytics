Doing your own analysis

• Perform an Excel PivotTable analysis by state
• Figure out the number of rejected applications for the state
of California.
• Count the loans by state and see what percentage of the
rejected loans came from California.
• How close is that to the relative proportion of the
population of California as compared to that of the United States?
• Run an Excel PivotTable by risk (or credit) score classification and DTI bucket
• Determine the number of rejected loans requested by those rated as having an excellent credit score.
